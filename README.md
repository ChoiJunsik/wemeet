## Problem

- Korea

    - 250 pets / 1day
    - 91K pets / 1year

- China
  - (Shanghai) pet registration system
    - However, 80% of pets are NOT registered.
    - Cannot come back
  - Shelters for them needed
  - Pets in the street attack citizen.

> : the time period following a pet loss where searching the pet has the highest chance of finding it out successfully.
